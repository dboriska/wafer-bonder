## Introduction
General description of the project.

## Original design files
* 3D CAD design files (.STEP and .FCStd) of the wafer bonder
* A vectorized drawing file (.svg) for the switch control box

## Auxiliary design files
Drawing files (.pdf) for each of the components that need to be fabricated. These can either be ordered through a prototyping supplier or personally machined.
* Slide block adapter (Slide_Block_Adapter.pdf)
* Wafer bonder base (Base.pdf)
* Wafer platform (Platform.pdf)
* Bonding flags (Flag.pdf)

## Photos
A rendering of the final product is included to help guide users with their fabrication.

## Instructions
Three files guide the user to design, fabricate, and use the wafer bonder:
* Design rationale
* Making the hardware
* Using the hardware
