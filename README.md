# Wafer bonder
This goal of this project is to make our wafer bonding tool open source. The following sections reflect folders in the project's master directory and are used to guide you through the design, fabrication, and usage.

## Introduction
General description of the project.

## Original design files
* 3D CAD design files (.STEP and .FCStd) of the wafer bonder
* A vectorized drawing file (.svg) for the switch control box

## Auxiliary design files
Drawing files (.pdf) for each of the components that need to be fabricated. These can either be ordered through a prototyping supplier or personally machined.
* Slide block adapter (Slide_Block_Adapter.pdf)
* Wafer bonder base (Base.pdf)
* Wafer platform (Platform.pdf)
* Bonding flags (Flag.pdf)

## Photos
A rendering of the final product is included to help guide users with their fabrication.

## Instructions
Three files guide the user to design, fabricate, and use the wafer bonder:
* Design rationale
* Making the hardware
* Using the hardware
